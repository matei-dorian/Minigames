# Minigames
After the first semester when I started learning the Python syntax I got curios and searched on my own how to create little console games using Python. I plan on adding more games in the future. This is a space invaders type of game where the player can move using the arrow keys and shoot by pressing space. The score and difficulty of the game inscreases with the number of enemies destroyed.
